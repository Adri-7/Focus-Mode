        <p>This extension have been done in a couple of days from an idea I had when
          I saw my girlfriend on facebook instead of studying. It is open source
          under GPLv3 and you can find the source code on <a href>Github</a>. If you
          experience any issue with it, feel free to report it, I'll try to
          correct it as soon as possible.</p>
