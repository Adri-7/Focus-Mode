        <p>This extension has been made in a couple of days from an idea I had when
          I saw my girlfriend on facebook instead of studying. It is open source
          under GPLv3 and you can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/Adri-7/Focus-Mode">Github</a>.
		  If you experience any issues with it, feel free to report them, I'll try to
          correct them as soon as possible.</p>
