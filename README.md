# Focus-Mode
A simple chrome extension to stay focused during work periods.

Focus Mode helps you stay focused when you work with your computer.

The idea is simple, when you work or study using your computer, there are so much distractions available on the internet that you easily loose your focus! So to help you preventing your future productivity decreasing, you just have to activate the Focus Mode!

Functionalities (when activated):
 - Block a predefined list of distracting websites (Facebook, Twitter, Instagramâ€¦)
 - Block a customizable list of distracting websites of your choice
 - Quick Add/Remove action on each website (with checkboxes)

This extension has been done in a couple of days from an idea I had when I saw my girlfriend on Facebook instead of studying. It is open source under GPLv3.
